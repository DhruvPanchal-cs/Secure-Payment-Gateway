🔐 Secure Payment Gateway (PCI-DSS Oriented)

A security-focused payment gateway simulation built using Flask that demonstrates real-world payment security controls, authentication mechanisms, and compliance-aligned design practices inspired by PCI-DSS standards.

This project focuses on how payments are secured, not just how payments work.

🚀 Key Security Features

1) Strong Authentication
2) bcrypt password hashing
3) Email-based OTP (MFA)
4)Account lockout after failed attempts
5)Session timeout & secure cookies
6)Payment Data Protection
7)AES-256 encryption for sensitive card data
8)Tokenization (no raw card data stored)
9)asked PAN handling (PCI-DSS aligned)
10)Fraud & Risk Controls
11)Device & IP-based login risk evaluation
12)Brute-force attack protection
13)Suspicious login blocking
14)Audit & Monitoring
15)Centralized security logging
16)Transaction audit trail
17)Admin security log dashboard
